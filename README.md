- **Interactive Results Table**: Detailed view of all processed biomarkers
- **Export Capabilities**: Generate merged reports in JSON format

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No server installation required - runs entirely in the browser

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser
3. Choose your desired tool:
    - **Biomarker Classification**: For individual biomarker evaluation
    - **Results Merger**: For combining multiple classification results

## Usage

### Individual Biomarker Classification

1. **Start Classification**: Click "Start Classification" from the main menu
2. **Configure Settings** (Optional): Click the settings icon to adjust:
    - Consistency threshold (tc)
    - Reproducibility threshold (tr)
    - Specificity threshold (ts)
    - Health improvement thresholds (t1, t2, t3)
    - Backend enabler toggle

3. **Follow the Guided Process**:
    - Enter biomarker name
    - Input consistency, reproducibility, and specificity values
    - Answer classification questions (General wellness vs Clinical)
    - Provide health outcome assessments
    - Enter scientific evidence details

4. **Review Results**: The system will classify your biomarker into one of several categories:
    - High scientific significance
    - Unproven significance
    - Not a good biomarker
    - Clinical use case (out of scope)

5. **Save Results**: Export detailed JSON file with complete classification data

### Results Merger

1. **Start Merger**: Click "Start Merging" from the main menu
2. **Upload Files**:
    - Drag and drop JSON files from previous classifications
    - Or click to browse and select files
    - Files are automatically validated

3. **Review Statistics**:
    - Total biomarkers processed
    - Distribution of classification results
    - Processing time analysis
    - Unique biomarker count

4. **Export Merged Results**: Generate comprehensive report combining all uploaded classifications

## Classification Algorithm

The system uses a multi-step decision tree algorithm:

1. **Initial Validation**: Checks if biomarker meets minimum thresholds for consistency, reproducibility, and specificity
2. **Use Case Classification**: Distinguishes between general wellness and clinical applications
3. **Health Outcomes Assessment**: Evaluates potential health benefits across three categories
4. **Scientific Evidence Review**: Analyzes peer-reviewed publications and official statements
5. **Final Classification**: Assigns final significance rating based on accumulated evidence

### Threshold Parameters

- **tc, tr, ts**: Minimum required values for consistency, reproducibility, and specificity
- **t1, t2, t3**: Thresholds for health improvement categories
- **Backend Enabler**: Toggle for alternative evaluation paths
